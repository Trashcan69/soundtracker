	* app/sample-display.c: The widget is now correctly being redrawn
	(there was a bug here; for example the selection sometimes was not

	* app/xm-player.c: Some FX'es are fixed: E9x (retrig) and Rxy (multi
	retrig) now work as they do in the FastTracker II: fully retrig the
	note, not only setting the sample position to the beginning (The Rxy
	FT2 bug is not emulated). Also the FXes' behaviour is correct (like
	in FT2) when the FX is triggered without a note. EDx (note delay)
	retrigs the last note when it's called without a note.
