### soundtracker

SoundTracker is a pattern-oriented music editor (similar to the DOS
program 'FastTracker'). Samples are lined up on tracks and patterns
which are then arranged to a song. Supported module formats are XM and
MOD; the player code is the one from OpenCP. A basic sample recorder
and editor is also included.
