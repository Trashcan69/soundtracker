1.0.x

Jack control modes: slave, master, autonomous;

Fix modules with broken samples or patterns. Develop an universal correlative seeking
procedure with adjustable threshold.

1.1.x

Modularized file operations;

Probably dynamic sound drivers' loading;

Plugins in the sample editor;

Preparation for modularization:
1) Separate libstsubs with gui-subs.c, st_subs and recode.c; remove endian-conv.c;
2) Free gui-subs.c from references to mainwindow;
3) Check dependency on driver-inout.h/audio.h in headers and other interdependencies
between headers. playback_driver, editing_driver -> audioconfig.c, in audio.c they are extern.
current_driver is internal in audio.c, audio_get_play_time() with -1 on failure,
separate audio-defs.h from audio.h Including gtk.h in gui.h isn't needed since it's included in gui-subs.h
4) GUI settings should be properties of a special GObject, with hooks to "notify::_name_" if necessary.
Check all settings to be correctly implemented (some of them should not be GUI settings) Just save all
settings on exit, remove the checkbox

5) Module loaders: flexible achive handling using XML specifications instead of hardcoded (even cascading
with tar). Automatic archive detection, then appropriate loader invocation after extraction.

1.2.x

MetaModule (.xxm) related stuff, see TODO.extra
New features: DSP can be applied to channel groups in the Mixing Desk; instrument triggers (limited
function set, but features like NNA will be implemented and not only).

2.x

New object-oriented module player with per-channel rendering. The tracker itself is still (x)xm-based.
